# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2024** project repository! This repository contains solutions and notes for the daily coding challenges hosted by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual event for programming enthusiasts of all skill levels.

## Project Structure

```
AoC24/
├── 01/
│   ├── data.txt        # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   ├── test.txt        # Example data provided in description for Day 1
│   ├── part1.py        # Solution for Part 1 of Day 1
│   ├── part2.py        # Solution for Part 2 of Day 1
├── 02/
│   ├── data.txt        # Puzzle input for Day 2
│   ├── test.txt        # Example data provided in description for Day 2
│   ├── part1.py        # Solution for Part 1 of Day 2
│   ├── part2.py        # Solution for Part 2 of Day 2
├── README.md           # Project overview and notes (this file)
└── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
```

Each day will have its own directory containing:
- `data.txt` and `test.txt`: The puzzle input for the day and data from description.
- `part1.py` and `part2.py`: Python scripts solving each part of the day's challenge.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sudo-grue/AoC24.git
    cd AoC24
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory for the specific day, e.g., `01`:
    ```bash
    cd 01
    ```

3. Run the solution scripts using Python:
    ```bash
    python part1.py
    python part2.py
    ```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Recommended: Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install any dependencies
    ```

## Notes

- **Puzzle Inputs**: Do not share your puzzle input. Your input is unique to your account and sharing it is against the rules of Advent of Code.
- **Optimization**: While the primary goal is to solve the puzzles, optimizing for performance and clean code is encouraged.
- **Learning and Fun**: Use this as an opportunity to learn new techniques, experiment with algorithms, and have fun!
